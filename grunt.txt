# Ideas
- Test workflow (.json.test -> a list of inputs and expected outputs for the associated .json file)
- Classification nodes (using embeddings APIs, specially train bge-m3? https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/sequence_classification)
- Svelte-based UI for editting and visualizing the behavior tree
- Svelte-based UI for running the behavior tree
